CHAPTER III.

CROOKED ANSWERS.

            "I answered him, as I thought good,
             'As many as red-herrings grow in the wood'."

__________






1.  Elementary.



1.  Whatever can be "attributed to", that is "said to belong to",
a Thing, is called an 'Attribute'.  For example, "baked", which
can (frequently) be attributed to "Buns", and "beautiful", which
can (seldom) be attributed to "Babies".

2.  When they are the Names of two Things (for example, "these
Pigs are fat Animals"), or of two Attributes (for example, "pink
is light red").

3.  When one is the Name of a Thing, and the other the Name of an
Attribute (for example, "these Pigs are pink"), since a Thing cannot
actually BE an Attribute.

4.  That the Substantive shall be supposed to be repeated at the
end of the sentence (for example, "these Pigs are pink (Pigs)").

5.  A 'Proposition' is a sentence stating that some, or none, or all,
of the Things belonging to a certain class, called the 'Subject',
are also Things belonging to a certain other class, called the
'Predicate'.  For example, "some new Cakes are not nice", that is
(written in full) "some new Cakes are not nice Cakes"; where the
class "new Cakes" is the Subject, and the class "not-nice Cakes"
is the Predicate.

6.  A Proposition, stating that SOME of the Things belonging to
its Subject are so-and-so, is called 'Particular'.  For example,
"some new Cakes are nice", "some new Cakes are not nice."

A Proposition, stating that NONE of the Things belonging to its
Subject, or that ALL of them, are so-and-so, is called 'Universal'.
For example, "no new Cakes are nice", "all new Cakes are not nice".

7.  The Things in each compartment possess TWO Attributes, whose
symbols will be found written on two of the EDGES of that compartment.

8.  "One or more."

9.  As a name of the class of Things to which the whole Diagram is
assigned.

10.  A Proposition containing two statements.  For example, "some
new Cakes are nice and some are not-nice."

11.  When the whole class, thus divided, is "exhausted" among the
sets into which it is divided, there being no member of it which
does not belong to some one of them.  For example, the class "new
Cakes" is "exhaustively" divided into "nice" and "not-nice" since
EVERY new Cake must be one or the other.

12.  When a man cannot make up his mind which of two parties he
will join, he is said to be "sitting on the fence"--not being able
to decide on which side he will jump down.

13.  "Some x are y" and "no x are y'".

14.  A Proposition, whose Subject is a single Thing, is called
'Individual'.  For example, "I am happy", "John is not at home".
These are Universal Propositions, being the same as "all the I's
that exist are happy", "ALL the Johns, that I am now considering,
are not at home".

15.  Propositions beginning with "some" or "all".

16.  When they begin with "some" or "no".  For example, "some
abc are def" may be re-arranged as "some bf are acde", each being
equivalent to "some abcdef exist".

17.  Some tigers are fierce, No tigers are not-fierce.

18.  Some hard-boiled eggs are unwholesome, No hard-boiled
eggs are wholesome.

19.  Some I's are happy, No I's are unhappy.

20.  Some Johns are not at home, No Johns are at home.

21.  The Things, in each compartment of the larger Diagram, possess
THREE Attributes, whose symbols will be found written at three of
the CORNERS of the compartment (except in the case of m', which is
not actually inserted in the Diagram, but is SUPPOSED to stand at
each of its four outer corners).

22.  If the Universe of Things be divided with regard to three
different Attributes; and if two Propositions be given, containing
two different couples of these Attributes; and if from these we
can prove a third Proposition, containing the two Attributes that
have not yet occurred together; the given Propositions are called
'the Premisses', the third one 'the Conclusion', and the whole set
'a Syllogism'.  For example, the Premisses might be "no m are x'"
and "all m' are y"; and it might be possible to prove from them
a Conclusion containing x and y.

23.  If an Attribute occurs in both Premisses, the Term containing
it is called 'the Middle Term'.  For example, if the Premisses are
"some m are x" and "no m are y'", the class of "m-Things" is 'the
Middle Term.'

If an Attribute occurs in one Premiss, and its contradictory in the
other, the Terms containing them may be called 'the Middle Terms'.
For example, if the Premisses are "no m are x'" and "all m' are
y", the two classes of "m-Things" and "m'-Things" may be called
'the Middle Terms'.

24.  Because they can be marked with CERTAINTY: whereas AFFIRMATIVE
Propositions (that is, those that begin with "some" or "all")
sometimes require us to place a red counter 'sitting on a fence'.

25.  Because the only question we are concerned with is whether the
Conclusion FOLLOWS LOGICALLY from the Premisses, so that, if THEY
were true, IT also would be true.

26.  By understanding a red counter to mean "this compartment CAN
be occupied", and a grey one to mean "this compartment CANNOT be
occupied" or "this compartment MUST be empty".

27.  'Fallacious Premisses' and 'Fallacious Conclusion'.

28.  By finding, when we try to transfer marks from the larger
Diagram to the smaller, that there is 'no information' for any of
its four compartments.

29.  By finding the correct Conclusion, and then observing that
the Conclusion, offered to us, is neither identical with it nor a
part of it.

30.  When the offered Conclusion is PART of the correct Conclusion.
In this case, we may call it a 'Defective Conclusion'.

To put a red counter on the division-line would only tell
us "ONE OF THE compartments is occupied", which we
know already, in knowing that ONE is occupied.

  20.  We had better take "persons" as Universe.  We
may choose "myself" as 'Middle Term', in which case
the Premisses will take the form

  I am a-person-who-sent-him-to-bring-a-kitten;
  I am a-person-to-whom-he-brought-a-kettle-by-mistake.

Or we may choose "he" as 'Middle Term', in which case the Premisses
will take the form

  He is a-person-whom-I-sent-to-bring-me-a-kitten;
  He is a-person-who-brought-me-a-kettle-by-mistake.

The latter form seems best, as the interest of the anecdote clearly
depends on HIS stupidity--not on what happened to ME.  Let us then
make m = "he"; x = "persons whom I sent, &c."; and y = "persons
who brought, &c."

  Hence, All m are x;
         All m are y.    and the required Diagram is

              i.e.  Some rainy periods are tiresome.

N.B.  These are not legitimate Premisses, since the
Conclusion is really part of the second Premiss, so that the
first Premiss is superfluous.  This may be shown, in letters,
thus:--

"All xm are y" contains "Some xm are y", which
contains "Some x are y".  Or, in words, "All rainy days
are tiresome" contains "Some rainy days are tiresome",
which contains "Some rainy periods are tiresome".

Moreover, the first Premiss, besides being superfluous, is
actually contained in the second; since it is equivalent to
"Some rainy days exist", which, as we know, is implied in
the Proposition "All rainy days are tiresome".

Altogether, a most unsatisfactory Pair of Premisses!

______________


Extract a Pair of Premisses out of each of the following: and
deduce the Conclusion, if there is one:--

92.  "The Lion, as any one can tell you who has been chased by them
as often as I have, is a very savage animal: and there are certain
individuals among them, though I will not guarantee it as a general
law, who do not drink coffee."

93.  "It was most absurd of you to offer it!  You might have known,
if you had had any sense, that no old sailors ever like gruel!"

"But I thought, as he was an uncle of yours--"

"An uncle of mine, indeed!  Stuff!"

"You may call it stuff, if you like.  All I know is, MY uncles are
all old men: and they like gruel like anything!"

"Well, then YOUR uncles are--"

94.  "Do come away!  I can't stand this squeezing any more.  No
crowded shops are comfortable, you know very well."

"Well, who expects to be comfortable, out shopping?"

"Why, I do, of course!  And I'm sure there are some shops, further
down the street, that are not crowded.  So--"

95.  "They say no doctors are metaphysical organists: and that lets
me into a little fact about YOU, you know."

"Why, how do you make THAT out?  You never heard me play the organ."

"No, doctor, but I've heard you talk about Browning's poetry: and
that showed me that you're METAPHYSICAL, at any rate.  So--"

___________________

Extract a Syllogism out of each of the following: and
test its correctness:--

96.  "Don't talk to me!  I've known more rich merchants than you
have: and I can tell you not ONE of them was ever an old miser
since the world began!"

"And what has that got to do with old Mr. Brown?"

"Why, isn't he very rich?"

"Yes, of course he is.  And what then?"

"Why, don't you see that it's absurd to call him a miserly merchant?
Either he's not a merchant, or he's not a miser!"

97.  "It IS so kind of you to enquire!  I'm really feeling a great
deal better to-day."

"And is it Nature, or Art, that is to have the credit of this happy
change?"

"Art, I think.  The Doctor has given me some of that patent medicine
of his."

"Well, I'll never call him a humbug again.  There's SOMEBODY, at
any rate, that feels better after taking his medicine!"

98.  "No, I don't like you one bit.  And I'll go and play with my
doll.  DOLLS are never unkind."

"So you like a doll better than a cousin?  Oh you little silly!"

"Of course I do!  COUSINS are never kind--at least no cousins I've
ever seen."

"Well, and what does THAT prove, I'd like to know!  If you mean
that cousins aren't dolls, who ever said they were?"

99.  "What are you talking about geraniums for?  You can't tell
one flower from another, at this distance!  I grant you they're
all RED flowers: it doesn't need a telescope to know THAT."

"Well, some geraniums are red, aren't they?"

"I don't deny it.  And what then?  I suppose you'll be telling me
some of those flowers are geraniums!"

"Of course that's what I should tell you, if you'd the sense to
follow an argument!  But what's the good of proving anything to
YOU, I should like to know?"

100.  "Boys, you've passed a fairly good examination, all things
considered.  Now let me give you a word of advice before I go.
Remember that all, who are really anxious to learn, work HARD."

"I thank you, Sir, in the name of my scholars!  And proud am I to
think there are SOME of them, at least, that are really ANXIOUS to
learn."

"Very glad to hear it: and how do you make it out to be so?"

"Why, Sir, I know how hard they work--some of them, that is.  Who
should know better?"

Extract from the following speech a series of Syllogisms, or
arguments having the form of Syllogisms: and test their correctness.

It is supposed to be spoken by a fond mother, in answer to a friend's
cautious suggestion that she is perhaps a LITTLE overdoing it, in
the way of lessons, with her children.

101.  "Well, they've got their own way to make in the world.  WE
can't leave them a fortune apiece.  And money's not to be had, as
YOU know, without money's worth: they must WORK if they want to
live.  And how are they to work, if they don't know anything?  Take
my word for it, there's no place for ignorance in THESE times!  And
all authorities agree that the time to learn is when you're young.
One's got no memory afterwards, worth speaking of.  A child will
learn more in an hour than a grown man in five.  So those, that
have to learn, must learn when they're young, if ever they're to
learn at all.  Of course that doesn't do unless children are HEALTHY:
I quite allow THAT.  Well, the doctor tells me no children are
healthy unless they've got a good colour in their cheeks.  And only
just look at my darlings!  Why, their cheeks bloom like peonies!
Well, now, they tell me that, to keep children in health, you
should never give them more than six hours altogether at lessons
in the day, and at least two half-holidays in the week.  And that's
EXACTLY our plan I can assure you!  We never go beyond six hours,
and every Wednesday and Saturday, as ever is, not one syllable of
lessons do they do after their one o'clock dinner!  So how you can
imagine I'm running any risk in the education of my precious pets
is more than I can understand, I promise you!"




THE END.
